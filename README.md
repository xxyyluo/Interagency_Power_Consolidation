**Abstract:** The inefficiency and ineffectiveness of environmental governance in developing countries are often attributed to the fragmentation of powers among multiple agencies with conflicting interests.  It is argued that integrating governance powers into one dedicated agency can improve governance by eliminating coordination challenges. However, our study of 289 Chinese cities from 2003-2017 reveals that the effects of interagency power consolidation on environmental governance are more complex than previously thought. We find that the effects of interagency power consolidation on environmental governance differ by pollutants and regions. It leads to a reduction in local air pollution (PM2.5) and a modest mitigation effect on the greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) in some cities, but it is ineffective in controlling water pollution that has large cross-jurisdictional externalities. In highly developed or highly polluted cities where environmental governance is crucial, power consolidation indeed improves governance outcomes. These heterogenous results reflect the mechanism of interagency power consolidation: while it enhances the dedicated agencyâ€™s capabilities, the ultimate outcome depends on the extent and manner in which the agency exercises these increased capabilities, which are decisions made by local government leaders from the perspective of their self-interests.
